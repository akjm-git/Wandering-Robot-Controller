# Wandering Robot Controller
A project undertaken as part of my COM596 module of Intelligent Robotics in 20/21. 
Repo contains robot controller and the environment used in the simulation of the robot using the Player/Stage simulator on a Linux Ubuntu VM.

The robot navigates free space randomly until a door/gap is detected. It then navigates through the door/gap. Once it has passes through the door/gap it resumes random wandering behaviours.

Controller written in C++.
